# helia-starmaps

This repository is a mirror of [Helia's official roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#%EF%B8%8F-milestones)
Helia is a project creating a focused, modular, opinionated, JavaScript-native implementation of IPFS (the Interplanetary File System).

The goal is a high-quality implementation of the IPFS protocol in TypeScript/JavaScript. It shall run in web browsers, in service workers, in browser extensions, in Node.js, and virtually everywhere else JS runs.
